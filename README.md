# Paw Print
  
## Description 
This is a MERN application that allows for the employees of a kennel to record what dogs they have in their care, the dog owners, and the rooms. Using Graphql and mongoose, the employee can now add the dogs, the owners, what rooms they are staying in, and important care instructions like feedings, vaccinations, and other information.

## Link
Deployed on Render https://paw-print.onrender.com/ 
  
## Installation 
Make sure all packages are installed, importantly Node and mongoDB. Insure that vite.config file exists, package.json has been installed in client, server, and root folder. The "npm run render-build" command will run the node modules and create a dist folder. The user can clone the repository or use straight from the deployed page. From the terminal, once everything has been properly installed npm run develop will run the application. React was used in the front end for a beautiful design and it was deployed using Render. There were intitially lots of issues with the backend, but once we regrouped and continued working, we were able to push past and create this application. Deployment was tough, initially we tried to deploy with Heroku but kept getting errors so we decided to go with Render and that worked.

  
## Usage
Useful for kennel employees, they can search for dogs, owners, and update rooms for their furry guests.
